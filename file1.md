📌 DevOps Foundations (2-3 Weeks)
This module covers the fundamental skills required for DevOps, including Linux, networking, shell scripting, Git, and automation.

1️⃣ Linux & Shell Scripting (Week 1)
🔹 Introduction to Linux
✅ Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Amazon Linux)
✅ File system structure and navigation (ls, cd, pwd, find, locate)
✅ File permissions and ownership (chmod, chown, umask)
✅ Process management (ps, top, kill, nice, htop)
✅ Package management (apt, yum, dnf)

🔹 Shell Scripting Basics
✅ Writing & executing basic shell scripts (.sh files)
✅ Variables, loops (for, while), and conditionals (if-else, case)
✅ Functions and arguments in Bash
✅ Automating tasks (cron jobs, systemctl, nohup)

🔹 Linux Networking & Security
✅ Basic networking commands (ifconfig, ip, netstat, ss, ping, traceroute)
✅ SSH & SCP (ssh-keygen, scp, rsync)
✅ Firewalls (iptables, ufw)

2️⃣ Git & Version Control (Week 2)
🔹 Git Basics
✅ Installing & configuring Git
✅ Git workflow: init, add, commit, push, pull
✅ Branching (checkout, merge, rebase)
✅ Resolving merge conflicts
✅ Stashing & cherry-picking

🔹 Working with Remote Repositories
✅ Cloning and forking repositories
✅ GitHub/GitLab workflows
✅ Pull Requests (PRs) and code reviews

🔹 Git Advanced Topics
✅ Git hooks & automation
✅ Rebasing vs. Merging
✅ Undoing changes (reset, revert, restore)

3️⃣ Introduction to Scripting & Automation (Week 3)
🔹 Introduction to Python for DevOps
✅ Variables, loops, and functions
✅ File handling (open(), read(), write())
✅ Using Python to interact with Linux commands (subprocess, os)
✅ Writing automation scripts (e.g., log monitoring, backups)

🔹 Using APIs in Automation
✅ REST API Basics (requests module in Python)
✅ Consuming APIs (AWS CLI, GitHub API, Jenkins API)

🔹 Basic Infrastructure Automation
✅ Automating cloud tasks with AWS CLI
✅ Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

🔥 Hands-on Projects for Foundations
✅ Automate user management in Linux (Shell script to add/delete users)
✅ GitHub project workflow (Collaborate using branches, PRs, and merge conflicts)
✅ Automate file backups (Python script with cron job)
